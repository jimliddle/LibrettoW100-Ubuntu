# LibrettoW100-Ubuntu
How to install Ubuntu on the Libretto W100 / W105 dual screen laptop
#Pre-Install
We are going to wipe the Libretto W100/105 so if you have any data that you wish to save do this before the next step
#Getting to the Boot Device Manager
The Libretto had no keyboard (the second screen being used as a virtual keyboard in windows) so you need to use the Libretto buttons to get to the device boot manager on start. Press the Power on button and then when you see the boot log press the keyboard and the home key on the second screen at the same time.
